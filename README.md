# ccent
ccent revision book, react with redux

npm install && npm run start


There is some sample content to get going with. 

features some markdown for easy reading the revision work, an ios style console that you can add commands, output and comments to.


most of the content is click to edit, click to view. 


todo: 

search. library installed, not implemented
drop down quick navigator - works from initial page but somewhat buggy outside that. 
delete content - not implemented
output revision notes in printable format
export/backup revision notes, currently localStorage implementation
